        <p>Beginning with an initial Dyslexia Screening consultation consisting of a pre-diagnostic interview and
          information gathering, we will first determine whether an assessment for our client will be suitable and
          necessary. Following on from the results of this initial screening, if it is deemed beneficial to our clients,
          they may proceed with Dyslexia Assessment.</p>
        <p>Consisting of a selection of assessment tests, accredited to the standards of the <a
            href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/" target="_blank">British Dyslexia
            Association</a> and carried out to the specifications of the <a href="https://sasc.org.uk/"
            target="_blank">SASC</a>, our Dyslexia Assessment will allow us to
          identify particular areas of focus and concern with our clients. These assessments can take place over one or
          more sessions as appropriate, allowing for participant comfort breaks and personal schedule..</p>
        <p>A feedback consultation will follow where the participant will be furnished with an assessment report
          containing recommendations specific to the individual relevant to their own home, work and education
          environments. Specific intervention classes tailored to the clientâ€™s assessment report will then be offered.

          employment and are offered in blocks, which allow the learner to pick specific targets and take time to
          develop relevant skills. A multi-sensory approach is incorporated as there is strong evidence of the its
